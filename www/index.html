GlueGen is a tool which automatically generates the Java and JNI code
necessary to call C libraries. It reads as input ANSI C header files
and separate configuration files which provide control over many
aspects of the glue code generation. GlueGen uses a complete ANSI C
parser and an internal representation (IR) capable of representing all
C types to represent the APIs for which it generates interfaces. It
has the ability to perform significant transformations on the IR
before glue code emission. GlueGen is currently powerful enough to
bind even low-level APIs such as the Java Native Interface (JNI) and
the AWT Native Interface (JAWT) back up to the Java programming
language. GlueGen is currently used to generate the <a

graphics API and the <a href="http://joal.dev.java.net/">JOAL</a>
interface to the OpenAL audio library.
